# 🕹️ **VR Development Projects** 🚀

Welcome to my **VR Development Projects**! 🎉 This repository showcases two immersive VR projects: **Escape Room VR** and **Scanner/Balloon Inflator**. Both projects explore custom interactions in virtual reality, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in Unity using the **XR Interaction Toolkit**. 🌍

## 💡 **Skills Acquired**

### 🤖 **General VR Skills**:
- **Intermediate VR Development**:
  - Program custom VR interactions to meet project requirements.
  - Extend the functionality of Unity’s default **interactable** and **interactor** objects.
  - Perform 3D vector calculations for precise and complex interactions.

---

### 🔒 **Escape Room VR**:
- **Keypad Interaction**: 🔢 Programmed a code entry system where the user inputs a code to receive a **keycard**.
- **Keycard Mechanism**: 🗝️ The user uses the keycard to unlock the door.
- **Sliding Door**: 🚪 Programmed the door to slide open, allowing the user to exit the escape room.

---

### 🔧 **Scanner and Balloon Inflator**:
- **Object Scanner**: 🔍 Developed a custom **scanner** that displays information about objects in the environment.
- **Balloon Inflator**: 🎈 Programmed an interactive **balloon inflator** that allows the user to inflate balloons for fun!

## 🌍 **Project Overviews**

### 🔒 **Escape Room VR**:
This project was designed to simulate a real-world task where I programmed final interactions for an escape room. The challenge was to extend the default VR interaction tools to create custom solutions for:
1. **Code Entry**: 🔢 Inputting a code to receive a keycard.
2. **Unlocking a Door**: 🗝️ Using the keycard to unlock the exit door.
3. **Sliding the Door Open**: 🚪 Allowing the player to exit the room by sliding the door open.

### 🔧 **Scanner and Balloon Inflator**:
In this project, I explored the **XRI Template Scene** and added two custom stations:
1. **Object Scanner**: 🔍 An interactive scanner that displays information (name, position, etc.) about objects in the scene.
2. **Balloon Inflator**: 🎈 A fun station where users can inflate colorful balloons by interacting with the inflator.

Both projects enhanced my understanding of Unity’s XR tools and the creative ways to extend its functionality for unique interactions.

## 🎯 **Project Objectives**

By the end of these projects, I developed the following abilities:

- 🛠️ **Programming VR Features**: Identify and implement high-level approaches to meet custom project briefs.
- 🔧 **Custom Interactions**: Extend Unity’s built-in tools to create engaging and functional VR interactions.
- 🧮 **3D Vector Math**: Perform mathematical operations on vectors to enable smooth and accurate VR mechanics.
- 🗂️ **Simulating Industry Projects**: Follow a project brief and complete tasks that simulate real-world VR development work.
